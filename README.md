> Hackaton Project: A scorekeeping app for the popular risk-taking card game, Whist!

## 1. What is Whist?

Whist is a trick taking card game, played with a standard 52-card French card deck. Player number can vary between 2 and 6 depending on the game version, but itâ€™s most commonly played by 4 people. In Hungary, it was popularized under the name "Rikiki". More info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whist).

## 2. Why make an app to track the scores?

While Simple Whist and Pair Whist are relatively basic game modes, and scores are easy to track, with more complicated game modes (such as Oh, hell!) come more complicated score tracking and calculations! This app will take away the pain and the time spent on calculations and everyone can just focus on doing their best to win.

## 3. Available game modes and rulesets

Rulesets:

* Rikiki
* Bid whist
* Simple Whist

Modes:

* ascending
* descending
* pyramid

Might be extended in the future.

## 4. Original Hackaton goals

* 4 main screens: menu, game mode selection, game, scoreboard
* 7 game types: Rikiki, Pair Whist, Diminishing Whist, Bid Whist, Simple Whist, Spades, Oh hell!
* 3 game modes: ascending, descending, pyramid

nice to have:
* high scores: store scores in a database
